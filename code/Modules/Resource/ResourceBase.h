    @brief resource base class
    
    This is the generic Oryol resource base class. Resources usually manage
    some external data object (like textures, vertices, animations, ...)
    which can be shared, can be created synchronously or asynchronously.
    Resources generally live in ResourcePools, and only a maximum number
    of resources of the same type can exist at one time. The creation
    of a resource is controlled by a matching Setup object, which holds
    all information required to create a resource object.
